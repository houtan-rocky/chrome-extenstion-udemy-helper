# Udemy Course Insights - Chrome Web Store Description

## Overview
Udemy Course Insights is a lightweight browser extension that reveals the real creation date of Udemy courses directly on course pages. Unlike Udemy's default display which only shows the "last updated" date, this extension helps you understand when a course was originally created, giving you better context to make informed learning decisions.

## Why This Matters
When browsing Udemy courses, you'll often see courses that were "updated" recently, but this doesn't tell you the full story. A course that was created in 2015 and last updated in 2024 might have received only minor updates, while the core content could be outdated. Similarly, a course created in 2023 and updated in 2024 is likely to have more current information.

**Udemy Course Insights solves this problem by:**
- Displaying the original creation date directly on course pages
- Helping you identify courses with fresh, up-to-date content
- Allowing you to avoid courses that may be outdated despite recent updates
- Providing transparency about course age vs. update frequency

## Key Features

### Creation Date Display
The extension automatically detects when you're viewing a Udemy course page and displays the original creation date in a clean, unobtrusive format. The creation date appears right below the course title, so you can see it at a glance without any extra clicks.

### Seamless Integration
The extension works automatically - no configuration needed. Once installed, it runs in the background and displays creation dates whenever you visit a Udemy course page. The information is presented in a way that matches Udemy's design, so it feels like a natural part of the website.

### Popup Dashboard
Click the extension icon to see detailed course information in a clean popup interface, including:
- Course title
- Real creation date (formatted for easy reading)
- Quick access to course insights

### Lightweight & Fast
Built with modern web technologies and optimized for performance. The extension uses minimal resources and doesn't slow down your browsing experience.

### Privacy-Focused
The extension only accesses Udemy course pages and doesn't collect or store any personal information. All data fetching happens locally in your browser.

## How It Works
1. Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store
2. Visit any Udemy course page (e.g., https://www.udemy.com/course/example-course/)
3. The creation date automatically appears below the course title
4. Click the extension icon to see more details in the popup
