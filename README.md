# 📚 Udemy Course Insights

> **Discover the real creation date of Udemy courses** - Make informed learning decisions by knowing when courses were originally created, not just when they were last updated.

## ✨ Features

## 🎯 Why This Matters

On the Udemy website, there is no information on the creation date of a course. Despite the fact that a course was last updated, its age and the fact that the update may have been minimal could mean that the course content is outdated or no longer relevant.

**Udemy Course Insights** solves this problem by displaying the real creation date of courses, helping you:
- Make better purchasing decisions
- Choose courses with the most up-to-date content
- Understand the true age of course materials
- Avoid outdated courses that may have received only minor updates
